Wow, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the G20 and I'm like, what on earth did I just see? These leaders are wild, all suited up, shaking hands like they're totally besties. You know when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   and you're like, is this real life or are they just all acting? This is kinda that vibe. Like, are they even listening to each other, or just talking to talk? Seriously, I felt like I could’ve 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   and not missed anything, haha.

So there's this whole part where everyone's all nodding like, Yeah, climate change, totally, we’re on it! But then they get into their limos and jets, and it's like, do these guys not see the irony? The speeches? Oh man, the speeches! Some were legit like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 paint dry. I get it, these things aren’t supposed to be page-turners but come on, give us something, people!

>The thing that really 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed me up was seeing them all struggle with tech. Like, there’s always that one leader who can’t figure out the mute button. You'd think they’d have assistants for that, but nah, it’s live comedy. Imagine being the one who’s all, Uh, can you hear me? At the G20 of all places! 😂 Then at one point, I'm thinking, this might just be the perfect time to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed - at least that'll make sense.

Anyway, speaking of nothing in particular, did you catch their faces when the climate activist did that surprise protest thing? That was the highlight, hands down. Honestly, the whole affair is like... I get it, these are big deals but do they actually change anything? I mean, call me cynical but it's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the same   with a different cast every year. And it's weirdly comforting, I guess? Like, these are the people in charge, and it’s both terrifying and kinda reassuring?

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { Console.WriteLine(G20); }

In the end, they did the group photo and everyone’s just awkwardly grinning. Ever notice how they all look like they're on a weird family holiday? The cool uncle, the grumpy grandpa, and that one cousin nobody talks to 'cause they’re always on their phone? Anyway, here's hoping they didn’t just look busy but actually got something done. Though my bet? Same time next year, same show!
